llc2160_01
 - Joern's original experiment on engaging

llc2160_02
 - same as llc2160_01 but on pleiades and with latest MITgcm code

llc2160_03
 - same as llc2160_02 but with split atmospheric pressure and tidal forcing

llc2160_04
 - same as llc2160_03 but using mean "sea level pressure" (jra55_pres_*)
   instead of "surface pressure" (jra55_pres_old_*)

ll2160_01
 - same as llc2160_04 but using lat/lon as opposed to llc configuration

ll2160_02
 - same as ll2160_01 but using coarser-res (1-degree) tidal forcing

ll2160_03
 - same as ll2160_02 but starting in 2008 instead of 2003

ll2160_04
 - same as ll2160_03 but using ERA5 instead of JRA55

ll2160_05
 - same as ll2160_04 but using tide_IAU_EARTH instead of tide

ll1815_01
 - same as ll2160_05 but with 1815x532 instead of 2160x540 domain
