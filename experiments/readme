llc2160_01
 - Joern's original experiment on engaging

llc2160_02
 - same as llc2160_01 but on pleiades and with latest MITgcm code

llc2160_03
 - same as llc2160_02 but with split atmospheric pressure and tidal forcing

llc2160_04
 - same as llc2160_03 but using mean "sea level pressure" (jra55_pres_*)
   instead of "surface pressure" (jra55_pres_old_*)

ll2160_01
 - same as llc2160_04 but using lat/lon as opposed to llc configuration

ll2160_02
 - same as ll2160_01 but using coarser-res (1-degree) tidal forcing

ll2160_03
 - same as ll2160_02 but starting in 2008 instead of 2003

ll2160_04
 - same as ll2160_03 but using ERA5 instead of JRA55

ll2160_05
 - same as ll2160_04 but using tide_IAU_EARTH instead of tide

ll1815_01
 - same as ll2160_05 but with 1815x532 instead of 2160x540 domain

ll1815_02
 - same as ll1815_01 but with 1045 33x28 instead of 105 121x76 tiles

ll1815_03
 - same as ll1815_02 but with blank tiles (970 33x28 tiles)

ll1815_04
 - same as ll1815_03 but with tidal amplitude and phase regenerated using
   ESR's TMD matlab toolbox

ll1815_04a
 - same as ll1815_04 but adding eastern (Gibraltar) tidal boundary conditions

ll1815_05
 - same as ll1815_04 but with llc_270 lateral boundary conditions
   set useOBCSYearlyFields=.TRUE. in data.obcs OBCS_PARM01
   lateral boundary conditions = 12 months: Jan09 to Jun09 and Jul08 to Dec08
   data.cal starts on January 1, 2008, with repeat 2008 atmospheric forcing

ll1815_06
 - same as ll1815_05 but adding Gibraltar tidal + llc_270 boundary conditions
   set useOBCSYearlyFields=.TRUE. in data.obcs OBCS_PARM01
   lateral boundary conditions = 12 months: Jan09 to Jun09 and Jul08 to Dec08
   data.cal starts on January 1, 2008, with repeat 2008 atmospheric forcing

ll1815_07
 - same as ll1815_06 but run 01Jan09-01Jul09 with 2009 forcing
   "ln -sf *08 *09" and "ln -sf *09 *10" then run 01Jul09-01Jul10
   "ln -sf *08 *10" and "ln -sf *09 *11" then run 01Jul10-01Jul11
   the soft links are just for at,mospheric forcing, not tidal potential
