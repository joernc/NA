atmospheric forcing:

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/input_ll
contains input files for 2160x540 lat/lon configuration derived
from "input" directory using input_ll/convert_input.m

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/input_ll1815
contains input files for 1815x532 lat/lon configuration derived
from "input_ll" directory using input_ll1815/convert_input.m

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/input_llc270
contains input files for 1815x532 lat/lon configuration derived
from llc270 optimization using input_llc270/mk_input.m

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/jra55

Note that engaging:/nobackup1/joernc/patches/jra55/jra55_pres_200[1-7]
have been renamed jra55/jra55_pres_old_200[1-7]
jra55/jra55_pres_old_200[1-7] are "surface pressure"
fields specified at 01:30/04:30/..../22:30
For consistency with other atmospheric reanalysis products
(e.g., ERA), jra55_pres_200[1-7] are now "mean sea level pressure"
fields specified at 0/3/6/9/12/... (same times as surface air temperature).

switch to a different, lower-accuracy, input file for
tidal potential calculation to be able to go beyond 2036.

lateral tidal boundary conditions created using instructions
and routines in NA/experiments/ll1815_04/matlab

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/tideBC_tpxo8_wEBC_1813
the instructions are in NA/experiments/ll1815_04a/matlab

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/hydrog_BC_IC_from_llc270/
Contains the hydrographic boundary conditions and Initial Conditions 
(U, V, Salt, Theta) calculated from 1/3 deg resolution llc 270 output
interpolated to the finer model grid. 
For exact description go to

interpolate_STUV_from_llc270_to_4km_make_netdf.ipynb
Boundary conditions for 12 months (a fake wraparound year
Jan2009--Jun2009-Jul2008--Dec2008) to make sure there is no
discontinuity in December.
Initial conditions for Jan 2009.
