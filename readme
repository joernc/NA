atmospheric forcing:

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/input_ll
contains input files for 2160x540 lat/lon configuration derived
from "input" directory using input_ll/convert_input.m

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/input_ll1815
contains input files for 1815x532 lat/lon configuration derived
from "input_ll" directory using input_ll1815/convert_input.m

/nobackup/dmenemen/tarballs/NA_2160/input_llc270
contains input files for 1815x532 lat/lon configuration derived
from llc270 optimization using input_llc270/mk_input.m

Note that engaging:/nobackup1/joernc/patches/jra55/jra55_pres_200[1-7]
have been renamed jra55/jra55_pres_old_200[1-7]
jra55/jra55_pres_old_200[1-7] are "surface pressure"
fields specified at 01:30/04:30/..../22:30
For consistency with other atmospheric reanalysis products
(e.g., ERA), jra55_pres_200[1-7] are now "mean sea level pressure"
fields specified at 0/3/6/9/12/... (same times as surface air temperature).
