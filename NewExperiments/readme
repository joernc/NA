Note that all new experiments except for ll740_01 and ll1480_01 have following configuration error.
The namelists/data.exf file should contain:

 &EXF_NML_OBCS
  obcsEperiod       = -12.,
  obcsNperiod       = -12.,
  obcsSperiod       = -12.,
 &

instead of:

 &EXF_NML_OBCS
 useOBCSYearlyFields=.TRUE.,
 &

As defined in pkg/obcs/obcs_exf_load.F
C-    obcsPeriod=-12 means input file contains 12 monthly means
C     records, corresponding to Jan. (rec=1) through Dec. (rec=12)

This configuration will no longer run with newer MITgcm code.
The reason that it did not crash when used for manuscript is because
it predates following modification introduced by Oliver Jahn:

checkpoint68e (2021/12/10)
o pkg/exf:
  - add option for interannual monthly forcing with pkg/cal by setting
    ${fld}_period=-1. (like -12. indicates climatological monthly forcing),
    available with or without useExfYearlyFields ; update exp. global_with_exf
    SST forcing to test this new option with and without useExfYearlyFields.

before checkpoint68e, pkg/exf/exf_getyearlyfieldname.F
added a year at end of filename under following conditions:
if (useYearlyFields.and.genperiod.gt.0) then
c     Complete filename with YR or _YEAR extension

after checkpoint68e, the condition was changed to:
      IF ( useYearlyFields .AND. genperiod.NE.-12 ) THEN
C     Complete filename with YR or _YEAR extension

What that means is that the manuscript configurations ran with "genperiod=0”, that is, steady,
January-mean open boundary conditions, instead of monthly-mean climatological boundary conditions.
Newer code attempts to add a year at end of filename when "genperiod=0”, and therefore crashes.
